# Contributing to Arcane

Thanks for helping make Arcane better! We've built a modern, streamlined development experience that gets you up and running in minutes.

## 🌟 Ways to Contribute

- 🐛 **Report bugs** using our issue templates
- 💡 **Suggest features** or improvements  
- 🔧 **Code contributions** (frontend, backend, DevOps)
- 📚 **Documentation** improvements
- 🌍 **Translations** via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/arcane-docker-management)
- 🧪 **Testing** and quality assurance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (that's it! 🎉)
- **VS Code** based IDE (recommended for the best developer experience)

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/arcane.git
cd arcane
```

### 2. Start Development Environment

```bash
./scripts/development/dev.sh start
```

That's it! The development environment will automatically:
- 🔥 Start both frontend and backend with hot reload
- 🐳 Handle all dependencies via Docker
- 📊 Set up health checks and monitoring
- 💾 Create persistent storage for your development data

Access your development environment:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 (SvelteKit with HMR)
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3552 (Go with Air hot reload)

## 🎯 VS Code Integration

For the best development experience, we've included VS Code tasks and workspace configuration.

### Recommended Extensions

When you open the project in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install our recommended extensions. These provide:
- Docker integration and management
- Go language support with debugging
- Svelte/TypeScript support
- Integrated terminal management

### One-Click Development Commands

Use `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" to access:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Start** | Start the development environment |
| **Stop** | Stop all services |
| **Restart** | Restart all services |
| **Rebuild** | Rebuild containers (after dependency changes) |
| **Clean** | Remove all containers and volumes |
| **Logs** | Interactive log viewer with service selection |
| **Open Frontend** | Launch frontend in browser |

### Quick Build Shortcut

Press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+B` to run the default build task (Start Environment).

## 🔍 Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git switch -c feat/my-awesome-feature
   # or
   git switch -c fix/issue-123
   ```

2. **Start development**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh start
   # or use VS Code Task: "Start"
   ```

3. **Monitor logs** (choose your preferred method):
   ```bash
   # Interactive selector
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh logs
   
   # Specific service
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh logs frontend
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh logs backend
   
   # Or use VS Code Task: "Logs"
   ```

4. **Make your changes** - hot reload will automatically update:
   - **Frontend**: Instant HMR via Vite
   - **Backend**: Auto-rebuild and restart via Air

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Environment Management
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/development/dev.sh start

# View service status
./scripts/development/dev.sh status

# Stop all services
./scripts/development/dev.sh stop

# Restart services (for config changes)
./scripts/development/dev.sh restart

# Rebuild containers (for dependency changes)
./scripts/development/dev.sh rebuild

# Clean up everything (nuclear option)
./scripts/development/dev.sh clean
```

### Debugging & Logs
```bash
# Interactive log selection
./scripts/development/dev.sh logs

# All services
./scripts/development/dev.sh logs

# Frontend only (Vite/SvelteKit)
./scripts/development/dev.sh logs frontend

# Backend only (Go/Air)
./scripts/development/dev.sh logs backend

# Shell access
./scripts/development/dev.sh shell frontend
./scripts/development/dev.sh shell backend
```

## 🎨 Code Quality

### Automatic Formatting & Linting

Both services include development-time linting and formatting:

- **Frontend**: ESLint + Prettier (configured in VS Code)
- **Backend**: Go fmt + Go vet (built into Air hot reload)

### Manual Commands

If you need to run checks manually:

```bash
# Frontend checks
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec frontend pnpm check
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec frontend pnpm format

# Backend checks  
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend go fmt ./...
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend go vet ./...
```

## 📝 Commit Guidelines

We use **Conventional Commits** for clear, semantic commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
git commit -m "fix: resolve Docker volume mounting issue"
git commit -m "docs: update development setup guide"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify API response handling"
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. **Keep changes focused** - One feature/fix per PR
2. **Test your changes** - Ensure both frontend and backend work
3. **Update documentation** - If you change APIs or add features
4. **Link issues** - Reference issues with "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456"
5. **Be responsive** - Address review feedback promptly

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code builds successfully in development environment
- [ ] Frontend hot reload works correctly
- [ ] Backend hot reload works correctly  
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] PR description explains the change and why it's needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts:**
```bash
# Stop and clean everything
./scripts/development/dev.sh clean

# Check for conflicting processes
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend port
lsof -i :3552  # Backend port
```

**Docker issues:**
```bash
# Reset Docker environment
./scripts/development/dev.sh clean
docker system prune -f

# Restart development
./scripts/development/dev.sh start
```

**VS Code tasks not working:**
- Ensure you've opened the project folder (not a parent directory)
- Install recommended extensions when prompted
- Restart VS Code if tasks don't appear
