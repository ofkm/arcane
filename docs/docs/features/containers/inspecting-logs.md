# Inspecting Containers & Logs

This guide covers how to view detailed information about a container (inspect) and access its logs using the Arcane UI.

## Inspecting Container Details

To view the full configuration and current state of a container:

1.  Navigate to the "Containers" list view.
2.  Click on the **Name** of the container you want to inspect.
3.  This will take you to the container's details page.
4.  This page presents comprehensive information retrieved using the equivalent of the `docker inspect` command (`#attachment_container_service_ts`). Key details often include:
    - **General Info:** ID, Name, Image, Status, Creation Date, Entrypoint, Command.
    - **State:** Detailed state information, including Running status, PID, Exit Code, Started/Finished times.
    - **Network Settings:** IP Address, MAC Address, Connected Networks, Port Mappings.
    - **Mounts:** Details about volumes and bind mounts, including source and destination paths.
    - **Environment Variables:** A list of all environment variables set within the container.
    - **Labels:** All labels applied to the container.
    - **Restart Policy:** The configured restart policy.
    - **Resource Limits:** Configured memory or CPU limits.
    - **Host Config:** Detailed host configuration options used when the container was created.

This detailed view is invaluable for troubleshooting configuration issues or understanding exactly how a container is set up.

## Viewing Container Logs

Arcane allows you to view the standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) streams generated by your containers.

1.  Navigate to the container's details page (by clicking its name in the list).
2.  Look for a "Logs" tab or section on the details page.
3.  Clicking this tab will display the container's logs (`#attachment_container_service_ts`).
4.  Arcane typically provides options to control the log view:
    - **Tailing:** Enable/disable automatic scrolling to show new logs as they arrive (live view).
    - **Timestamps:** Show/hide timestamps for each log entry.
    - **Line Count:** Specify the number of recent log lines to retrieve initially (e.g., last 100 lines, all lines).
    - **Since/Until:** Potentially filter logs based on a time range (if supported).
    - **Refresh:** Manually fetch the latest logs if tailing is disabled.

Container logs are essential for debugging application errors, monitoring activity, and understanding what a container is doing.
