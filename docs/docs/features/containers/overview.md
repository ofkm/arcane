# Containers Overview

The "Containers" section is the core of Arcane, providing a comprehensive interface for managing individual Docker containers running on your connected Docker host.

## Key Concepts

- **Container:** A runnable instance of a Docker image. It packages application code with all its dependencies.
- **Container ID:** A unique identifier (long or short hash) for a specific container instance.
- **Container Name:** A user-friendly name assigned to a container (either automatically generated by Docker or specified during creation).
- **Image:** The blueprint from which a container is created (e.g., `nginx:latest`).
- **State:** The current status of a container (e.g., `running`, `exited`, `paused`, `restarting`).
- **Ports:** Mappings between ports on the host machine and ports inside the container.
- **Volumes:** Mechanisms for persisting data generated by and used by containers, often mapping a host directory or a named volume to a directory inside the container.
- **Environment Variables:** Key-value pairs passed into the container to configure its behavior.
- **Network:** How the container connects to other containers or the host machine.

## Core Functionality

Based on the `container-service.ts` and related UI components, Arcane allows you to perform the following actions on Docker containers:

- **List Containers:** View all containers on the Docker host (both running and stopped). The list typically displays the container's Name, ID, Image, and Status (`#attachment_columns_ts`, `#attachment_page_svelte`).
- **Create Containers:** Launch new containers from existing images using a detailed configuration dialog (`#attachment_create_container_dialog_svelte`). This includes setting:
  - Name and Image
  - Port Mappings
  - Volume Mounts
  - Environment Variables
  - Network Settings (including static IPs for user-defined networks)
  - Restart Policies
  - Healthchecks
  - Labels
  - Command Overrides
  - User specification
  - Resource Limits (Memory, CPU)
- **Inspect Containers:** View detailed information about a specific container, including its configuration, network settings, mounts, state, logs, and more (`#attachment_container_service_ts`).
- **Control Container State:**
  - **Start:** Start a stopped container (`#attachment_ContainerActions_svelte`, `#attachment_container_service_ts`).
  - **Stop:** Stop a running container (`#attachment_ContainerActions_svelte`, `#attachment_container_service_ts`).
  - **Restart:** Restart a running container (`#attachment_ContainerActions_svelte`, `#attachment_container_service_ts`).
- **Remove Containers:** Delete stopped containers. A "force" option might be available to remove running containers (use with caution) (`#attachment_ContainerActions_svelte`, `#attachment_container_service_ts`).
- **View Logs:** Fetch and display logs generated by a container, with options for tailing, timestamps, and specifying the number of lines (`#attachment_container_service_ts`).
- **View Statistics:** The UI displays summary statistics like total, running, and stopped container counts (`#attachment_page_svelte`).

## Container Data

Arcane represents container information using structures defined in `container.type.ts`, including:

- `ServiceContainer`: For list views, containing essential details like ID, name, image, state, status, and ports.
- `ContainerConfig`: For creation, defining all the configurable options.
- Detailed inspection data mirroring the output of `docker inspect`.
