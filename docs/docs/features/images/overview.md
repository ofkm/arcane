# Image Management

## What Can You Do With Images in Arcane?

- **View Images:** See a list of all Docker images on your system, including their tags, size, and when they were created.
- **Pull Images:** Download new images from Docker Hub or another registry by entering the image name and tag (like `nginx:latest`).
- **Inspect Images:** Click on an image to see more details, such as its ID, tags, creation date, and configuration.
- **Remove Images:** Delete images you no longer need. Arcane will warn you if an image is in use by a container.
- **Prune Images:** Clean up unused images to free up disk space. You can remove dangling images (those without tags) or all images not used by any container.
