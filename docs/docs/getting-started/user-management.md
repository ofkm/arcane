# User Management

Arcane comes with built-in user management to help you control who can access your app.

## Default Admin User

- On your first run, Arcane will automatically create a default admin user if no users exist.
- **Username:** `arcane`
- **Password:** `arcane-admin`
- The onboarding flow will force you to change this password on first run as well.

## Adding Users

- Only admins can add new users.
- Go to the user management section in the app (or use the API if you are a developer).
- Fill in the required details: username, display name, email, and password.

## Changing Passwords

- Users can change their own password after logging in.
- Admins can reset passwords for other users.
